# RollMahBallsProject

This is to mess around with and learn, brush off on some ways of doing things.

# Goals..

WiP: Make a plugin with a fairly generic random maze generator with room support. Oh and multithreaded generation.

WiP 0.1: Make models and prefabs to build the maze with.

# Done so far..
Player ball that you roll with torque forces and fully integrated in the physics engine.
Decent camera that doesn't clip into walls.


Feel free to do whatever you want with this. I won't be using anything but my own code and models.

Oh and lastly I did put this together over at https://www.twitch.tv/munglo
